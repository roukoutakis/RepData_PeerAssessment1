## Loading and preprocessing the data
Load the data (i.e. read.csv())
```{r, echo=TRUE}
activity<-read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(activity$date, activity$steps)
```

Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(na.omit(activity$steps))
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values
Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
```{r, echo=TRUE}
sum(!complete.cases(activity))
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
